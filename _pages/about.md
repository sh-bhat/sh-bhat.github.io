Hi! I am a master's student at UC Berkeley's School of Information, where I specialize in human-centered artificial intelligence. My academic focus is on equitable algorithms, especially on applications in minority issues and non-western contexts. Before grad school, I worked in data science and acaedemic research, where most of my work centered around natural language processing. Feel free to reach out if any of this interests you!
