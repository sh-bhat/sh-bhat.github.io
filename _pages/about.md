Hello! I'm a specialist in human-centered artificial intelligence, currently working with Meta's Generative AI team. As a grad student at UC Berkeley, I studied human-computer interaction and natural language processing with an emphasis on social contexts.

Over the course of my career, I've dabbled in everything from mixed-methods research to data science and engineering - picking up skills along the way from my time in non-profits, the tech industry, and academia. More about my work [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zO_VYiC0VvjUGvw7PKXc1ZDOiVmrN8Fh/view?usp=sharing). Feel free to reach out if any of this interests you!
